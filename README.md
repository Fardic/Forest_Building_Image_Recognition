# Forest_Building_Image_Recognition
## Classification of Intel Forest and Building Images 

This is an image classification project that differ images of forests from buildings. 3 models are used in the project which are
K-Means Clustering, Loogistic Regression and 2 layer Neural Network.

The machine learning algorithms in the code is written without using any machine learning libraries.

Confusion matrices of each model are shown below.

Logistic Regression Confusion Matrix

CM | True | False |
--- | --- | --- |
Positive | 417 | 87 | 
Negative | 56 | 350 | 

K-Means Clustering Confusion Matrix

CM | True | False |
--- | --- | --- |
Positive | 2340 | 606 | 
Negative | 396 | 2021 | 

Artificial Neural Network Confusion Matrix

CM | True | False |
--- | --- | --- |
Positive | 414 | 65 | 
Negative | 59 | 372 |
